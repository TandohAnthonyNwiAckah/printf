ALX project 0x11. C - printf
============================

 printf is the C language function to do format-ted printing.
 The printf function is a powerful device for print-ing numbers and
 other things stored in variables.With this power there is a certain
 amount of com-plexity. Taken all at once, the complexity makes printf
 seem almost impossible to understand. Butthe complexity can be easily
 unfolded into simplefeatures, including width, precision, signage, justi-ﬁcation,
 and ﬁll. By recognizing and understand-ing these features, printf
 will become a useful andfriendly servant in your printing endeavors.
